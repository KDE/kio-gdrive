Install to custom prefix
=========================

You can install kio-gdrive to your preferred installation prefix,
as long as kdeinit5 has been installed in the same prefix.

Locate Debug Output
===================

You will not see the worker's output in the terminal where you started e.g. Dolphin.
On systemd distros the output will go in the journalctl (assuming Qt built with the -journald option).
A quick way to locate the relevant logs is the following command:

    journalctl -b | grep kf.kio.workers.gdrive

This will only show the logs since the last boot. To retrieve also older logs, you can filter the messages by the process who emitted them (kdeinit5):

    journalctl $(which kdeinit5) | grep kf.kio.workers.gdrive

Enable Debug Output
===================

Th gdrive worker uses categorized debug output. Normally you would enable its output with a simple:

    export QT_LOGGING_RULES="kf.kio.workers.gdrive=true"

However, you need to make sure this variable is present in the environment of kdeinit5,
which is the process that starts the ioworker.

A simpler alternative is to create (or edit) ~/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini with the following content:

[Rules]
kf.kio.workers.gdrive=true
