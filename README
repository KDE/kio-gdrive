Hello there, lonely wanderer and welcome to the magical land of Google Drive!




KNOWN ISSUES
============

GDocs file don't have file size
  Not our fault, Google Drive API simply does not return filesize of these files.
  I think it's because they are in the Google Docs format, so the size is irrelevant,
  since only GDocs can open them, and if we convert the files into .ODT or .DOCX or
  whatever else, the size is different (so we would have to count it manually)

Folders have "Unknown" size
  We cannot provide size information on folders, so I guess this actually implemented
  in KIO/Dolphin by simply listing each folder and showing the number of files. This
  is probably not done on remote filesystems to save bandwidth and improve performance,
  hence the size is "unknown"



TODO
===========

Make Trash work again
  The original plan was to have a virtual "Trash" folder top-level directory listing,
  which would contain all trashed files and folders. The feature has been removed
  though, because it breaks with folders. Trashed folders still have their original
  parent reference set, so we fail to resolve their UID properly in
  KIOGDrive::resolveFileIdFromPath(). This could be solved by not using nice file names
  in trash, but that would mean two codepaths in all io methods just handle the trash
  case.
