Implicit dependency on file managers
=====================================

KIO GDrive requires a KIO-enabled file manager at runtime,
otherwise there is no way to setup a Google Drive account.
This can be Dolphin or Gwenview or Konqueror.

The slave installs a .desktop file that enables integration with
the Dolphin's Places panel and the Plasma's Folder View widget.
