Implicit dependency on file managers
=====================================

KIO GDrive requires a KIO-enabled file manager at runtime,
otherwise there is no way to setup a Google Drive account.
This can be Dolphin or Gwenview or (the unreleased) Konqueror.

The slave installs a .desktop file that enables Dolphin integration
in the applications launcher (if Dolphin is installed).
This can be prevented by passing `-DDOLPHIN_INTEGRATION=OFF` to cmake.
